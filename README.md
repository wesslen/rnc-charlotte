## Charlote RNC Tweet Tool

This tool tracks over 7,000 tweets collected from July 2 to 16, 2018 relating to the local city debate on hosting the 2020 RNC Convention.

The tool was built from [Garrick Aden-Buie's Excellent RStudio::conf() Twitter dashboard](https://github.com/gadenbuie/rsconf_tweets) and the data was pulled using [Mike Kearney's rtweet R package](http://rtweet.info/)

You can view the dashboard here: [https://unccviscenter.shinyapps.io/rnc-charlotte/](https://unccviscenter.shinyapps.io/rnc-charlotte)

## Keyword Search

Studying Twitter typically requires keywords to filter to tweets; however, this problem is really hard (e.g., see [King et al.](https://gking.harvard.edu/publications/computer-assisted-keyword-and-document-set-discovery-fromunstructured-text)).

For this data set, I used the following keywords (case insensitive):

"norncinclt or defendcharlotte or cltcc or rnc*"

*RNC was combined with local Charlotte terms (e.g., Charlotte, Vi Lyles, city council)
